## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Hyperbolic Attention Mechanism
- Uses hyperbolic distance instead of dot product for attention scores
- Implements Einstein midpoint for weighted averaging in hyperbolic space
- Maintains numerical stability near the Poincaré ball boundary

### 2. Complete Transformer Architecture
- Hyperbolic multi-head attention
- Hyperbolic feed-forward networks
- Hyperbolic layer normalization
- Möbius addition for residual connections
- Hyperbolic positional encoding

### 3. Seamless Integration
- Drop-in replacement for ConvGRU when `--use_transformer` is specified
- Compatible with existing loss functions and training procedures
- Maintains same input/output interface as original architecture
- Works with both Euclidean and hyperbolic feature representations

### 4. Numerical Considerations
- Optional 64-bit precision for hyperbolic operations (`--fp64_hyper`)
- Careful initialization to avoid boundary issues
- Gradient clipping in hyperbolic operations
- Stable implementation of hyperbolic mathematical operations

## Usage

### Basic Command
```bash
python main.py --hyperbolic --use_transformer --num_heads 8 --transformer_layers 4 [other args...]
```

### Training Example
```bash
./scripts/train/train_kinetics_hyperbolic_transformer.sh
```

### Evaluation Example
```bash
./scripts/eval/eval_hyperbolic_transformer.sh
```

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Test hyperbolic transformer components
python -m pytest tests/test_hyperbolic_transformer.py -v

# Test integration with main model
python -m pytest tests/test_models.py::TestModel::test_model_forward_hyperbolic_transformer -v
```

## Mathematical Foundation

The implementation is based on:
1. **Poincaré Ball Model**: All operations occur in the Poincaré ball with curvature κ = -1
2. **Hyperbolic Distance**: Attention scores computed using hyperbolic distance metrics
3. **Einstein Midpoint**: Weighted averaging using hyperbolic geometry
4. **Möbius Operations**: Linear transformations and additions in hyperbolic space

## Benefits

1. **Better Hierarchical Modeling**: Hyperbolic space naturally represents tree-like and hierarchical relationships
2. **Improved Long-Range Dependencies**: Attention mechanism captures complex temporal dependencies
3. **Geometric Inductive Bias**: Poincaré ball geometry provides useful inductive bias for certain data types
4. **Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrates with existing hyperbolic neural network components

## Performance Considerations

- Slightly higher computational cost due to hyperbolic operations
- Memory usage comparable to standard transformers
- Benefits from GPU acceleration for parallel attention computation
- Optional 64-bit precision for numerical stability

This implementation successfully extends the video prediction framework with state-of-the-art attention mechanisms operating in hyperbolic space, providing researchers with a powerful tool for modeling complex temporal relationships in video data.
